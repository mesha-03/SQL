-- Here are potential answers to the example questions in the final SQL project.-- 
-- Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. -- 



SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';




-- Show only the Customers from Brazil. --

SELECT * 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country = "Brazil" ;





-- Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil.--
--The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country. --
--SN: the INNER JOIN ensures we only retrieve matching records between the customers and invoices tables,--
--focusing on customers from Brazil based on the BillingCountry. --

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers cust
INNER JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';



--Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.--

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';




-- Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.--

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry 
FROM chinook.Invoices ;
